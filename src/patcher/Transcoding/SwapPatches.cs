    /// re-negotiated stream exists. That immediate teardown is the gap this design closes.
    ///
    /// THE FIX. KillTranscodingJobsPrefix defers (skips) that call for a session this plugin
    /// admitted as a live-apply swap (see UpscaleEngine.TryAdmitSwap, driven by the "swapfrom"
    /// query marker network.js now attaches - see UpscalePatches.BuildVerdict). StartFfMpegPostfix

    /// until the new job's first segment file exists (or the job exits) - see its own wait loop -
    /// so no separate filesystem watch was needed, that plumbing already existed in stock Jellyfin.
    /// Once the new job for the SAME DEVICE is ready, UpscaleEngine.OnNewJobReady replays the
    /// deferred kill for real, tearing the old process down only now. A swap that never completes
    /// (the client never re-negotiates, or admission never happened) times out on its own
    /// (UpscaleEngine.SweepExpiredSwaps) and still tears the old job down - it is never orphaned.

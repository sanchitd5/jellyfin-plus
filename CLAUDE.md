# CLAUDE.md

Read **[AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md)** first - architecture invariants, verification standards, and the list
of things that have already gone wrong. Everything in it applies.

Root holds the entry points only (README, INSTALL, ENHANCEMENTS, AGENTS, this file, context-map). Every
other document is under `docs/` (`architecture/`, `filters/`, `research/`, `roadmap/`, `tasks/`),
indexed in [docs/README.md](docs/README.md). A new document goes in the matching folder and gets a row
in that index.

This file adds what is specific to working on this repo with Claude Code.

## Where the work actually happens

Developed against a **live Jellyfin server**, not locally. There is no meaningful local test suite:
the plugin does nothing without Jellyfin's assemblies, a GPU and a real transcode. Expect to build
on, deploy to and verify against a running server over SSH.

Consequences:

- **A build that compiles proves almost nothing.** Probe the served segment.
- **Deploy atomically.** Half-applied state is visible to whoever is watching. Copying new assemblies
  and only then finding the config page needs a rebuild means a broken dashboard in the meantime.
- **Restarts are expensive and visible.** They kill in-flight transcodes, cancel library scans and log
  dashboard users out. Batch changes that need one; client-side changes need none.
- **Someone may be watching something right now.** Check before restarting. Never kill ffmpeg
  processes indiscriminately to tidy up - stop your own sessions by id.

## What this project is made of now

**Jellyfin Plus = GPU video enhancement + search/library quality-of-life.** The second half (tag
search and wildcards, sort & filter sheet, pagination/infinite scroll, filter-key cache and FTS5
index in `jellyfin.db`, More Like This, bulk tag edit, mobile card actions) is catalogued in
**[ENHANCEMENTS.md](ENHANCEMENTS.md)** - every patch, route, request param, storage key and table,
with its fail-soft and access guarantees. AGENTS.md invariants 13-18 govern that half: never widen
access, faster must mean identical (digest-proved on the real DB), fail soft to stock, plugin tables
only, params are a wire contract, no library content in the repo.

Five custom ffmpeg filters live in a **separate patched binary** beside the stock one:
`vf_oidn`, `vf_optix`, `vf_ort`, `vf_fsr2`, `vf_dlss`. The shim routes per session and asks the binary
which filters it carries, stripping nodes it lacks - so a rebuild that drops a `vf_*.c` degrades
gracefully instead of failing every session. **If you rebuild that binary, all five must survive.**
Check `-filters` afterwards. `scripts/proxmox-build.sh --with-ffmpeg` builds it, verifies all five
are present, and keeps the previous binary at `<binary>.prev` whether it succeeds or fails.

**A filter being present does not mean it runs, and the two binaries disagree in both directions.**
`nlmeans_vulkan` exists in both and, before shaderc was built from source, compiled only in the
stock one: a session combining a Vulkan denoise with a patched-only filter died with FFmpeg exit
234, a dead stream rather than a degraded picture. The engine still carries the guard that drops the
conflicting pass and says so. Assume a run-time-compiling filter differs between the two builds
until a test on the actual binary says otherwise.

Fourteen axes reach the ffmpeg command: `upscale`, `sr`, `deblur`, `denoise`, `deblock`, `neural`,
`game`, `refine`, `chroma`, `deband`, `kernel`, `jitter`, `depth`, `reactive`. Each travels as a
lowercase query parameter through `StreamOptions`.

Two more filters, `dlpp_rtcuda` and `vsr_rtcuda`, build into that same binary and are verified
GPU-resident, but they are opt-in, not in the mandatory five, and touch none of the fourteen axes
above yet - the plugin's 5-place checklist for them (below) hasn't been started. Before working on
either, read `docs/tasks/TASK.md` ("Track B: DLPP", "Track C") and `docs/architecture/INTEGRATION_DESIGN.md` for what's proposed
and what's still open, not just this file.

The NVIDIA Maxine VFX SDK video-super-resolution filter (`vf_vsr.c`) is retired as a neural target
(`docs/filters/VSR.md`'s RETIRED banner, build flag renamed `WITH_VSR` -> `WITH_MAXINE_VSR`) - `vsr_rtcuda` above
is the live replacement under the same "VSR" name, and the two are not interchangeable in docs or
build flags.

**Nothing here pre-processes video.** The source file is never read-and-rewritten; enhancement
happens inside the transcode. A batch pass was planned and dropped for exactly this: it would have
written a second copy of every processed item into the library. See the programme in
`docs/roadmap/improvements.md` for what that cost and what survives.

## CUDA kernels: never hand-write PTX

Write kernels as real CUDA C (`.cu`), compile via `clang -x cuda --cuda-device-only -S -nocudainc
-nocudalib` (or `nvcc` if present) to PTX. Never author `.ptx` by hand. Better correctness,
readability, maintainability - hand-written PTX is how the p010le bug went unnoticed as long as it
did. Fall back to hand-written PTX only if neither compiler path works on the build machine, and
say so explicitly in the report/commit if that fallback is used.

## Adding a level or an axis

The client is data-driven by design, because levels and axes keep arriving:

- **A new level** is one entry in an options array - no rendering code.
- **A new axis** is one entry in `CONTROLS` plus one line in `LIVE_ROWS`, with `probeKey` naming what
  the probe returns.
- **Display names and degraded wording come from the probe**, not from JavaScript. The string lives
  beside the level definition on the server on purpose.

Server side, an axis is only real when `UpscaleEngine.Option(state, ...)` reads it. A control whose
parameter nothing reads is dead UI - do not ship one.

## Before you change the config page

`src/Configuration/configPage.html` is an embedded resource compiled into the plugin DLL, so a change
needs a rebuild **and** a restart - not a static file you can edit in place. Fetch the **served** page
through the API when diagnosing; the on-disk source may not be what is running.

Adding a setting means touching all of these together, or the page breaks:

1. `src/Configuration/PluginConfiguration.cs` - the property and its default
2. `src/patcher/Transcoding/UpscaleSettings.cs` - the patcher-side mirror (settings cross the ALC boundary as JSON)
3. `src/Configuration/configPage.html` - **both** the form control and the load/save script lines
4. The probe, so the client can offer it
5. The session/status reporting, if it changes what the server does

## Before you change the client

`web/jellyfin-plus.js` is a **generated build output, not checked into git** (gitignored as of the
`real-es-modules` pass, 2026-09-24, same as `web/node_modules`) and not the source. Build it with
`scripts/build-web-panel.sh` before publishing, deploying, or handing the repo to a fresh checkout
- there is no committed copy to fall back to. The real source is **real ES modules** with real
`import`/`export`, under `web/src/`, grouped MVC-style, plus one entry point:

| directory | holds |
|---|---|
| `web/src/lib/` | dependency-free leaves: `storage-migrate.js` (one-time old-to-new localStorage key rename, imported first by `bootstrap.js`), `log.js` (`log()`), `dom.js` (`el()`), `utils.js` (`isOff()`) |
| `web/src/model/` | data and pure(ish) session logic: `controls-data.js` (`CONTROLS`/`SR_ALIASES`/`GAME_OPTION_KEYS`/`DEFAULT_PREFS`), `state.js` (the `state` singleton, `LADDER_SHARPEN`/`LADDER_SR`/`FPS`/`DENOISE_COST`/`NEURAL_COST`/`GAME_COST`/`COSTS`/`DEBLOCK_COST`), `prefs-store.js` (`savePrefs`, loads prefs on import), `costing.js` (`eligibleTargets`/`srWouldRun`/`stageCost`/`selectionCost`/`costHint`/`serverConfig`), `ladder.js` (`ladder`/`recommendedStage`/`sameStage`/`currentStage`/`stageText`), `effective.js` (`effective`/`displayPrefs`/`shownPrefs`/`anyEnhancement`/`summaryText`/`advancedText`), `conflicts.js` (`CONFLICTS` logic: `axisConflict`/`optionInert`/`costSuffix`/`shortName`/the CUDA-native neural predicates) |
| `web/src/controller/` | orchestration and the network/DOM/webpack seams: `probe.js` (`probeServer`/`axisControls`/`controlNote`), `network.js` (`wireParams`/`addParams`/the fetch+XHR hooks that mark the TranscodingUrl), `live-apply.js` (player lookup, `replayHere`/`directPlaying`/`requestRestream`/`activeState`), `live-block.js` (`LIVE_ROWS`/`staleNote`/`liveLines`/`fetchServerState`), `playback-hooks.js` (playback-event hooking, `openEnhancePanel`, Playback Info annotation), `webpack-hook.js` (the webpack chunk hook), `action-sheet.js` (wrapping the player's settings sheet) |
| `web/src/view/` | `panel-dom.js`: disclosure/row/quality-section rendering, panel dragging, `renderPanel`/`closePanel`/`panelEl` |
| `web/src/bootstrap.js` | the entry point: imports the hooks above and runs the install try/catch |
| `web/src/banner.txt` | the file's doc comment, injected as the bundle's banner (not a module) |

Full list with every export/import, one line each: `context-map.md` at the repo root. The QoL modules
(search page, library filters, cards, playback, detail pages, bulk tags) are listed there too, not in
the table above.

`bootstrap.js` installs each QoL feature through `feature(name, install)` - its own try/catch, so one
failing installer cannot take the others down. **Order matters** for the request hooks:
`storage-migrate.js` is the first import (before `prefs-store` reads prefs); `installSearchCensus`
runs BEFORE `hookFetch`/`hookXhr` so it wraps innermost and judges the final URL; the play-all and
library-filter hooks run AFTER them. The bundle is minified by default (`JP_NO_MINIFY=1
scripts/build-web-panel.sh` for a readable build when debugging).

Real imports surfaced the actual dependency graph the old `cat`-based split hid: several modules
import each other in both directions (e.g. `model/effective.js` <-> `controller/network.js`,
`controller/live-apply.js` <-> `view/panel-dom.js`). This is legitimate ES module circularity, not
a mistake to unwind - every one of those edges is a function call resolved at call time, never a
value read at module-evaluation time, which is exactly the case ES modules (and esbuild) support.
Don't "fix" a circular import here by inlining or duplicating code to break the cycle; if a genuine
init-order bug shows up, it will be a `ReferenceError` on first run, not a lint warning.

Run `scripts/build-web-panel.sh` to regenerate `web/jellyfin-plus.js` from `web/src/bootstrap.js` and
everything it imports. It shells out to **esbuild** (`--bundle --format=iife`), installed under
`web/node_modules` (gitignored) from `web/package-lock.json` (checked in) - run `npm install` in
`web/` once per build machine before the first build. esbuild is a **build-time-only** dependency:
it never appears in the bundled output and is never needed on the server/CT114, only wherever this
script runs. **Edit the files in `web/src/`, never `web/jellyfin-plus.js` directly** - a hand-edit
there is silently overwritten by the next build. The runtime output is still one plain IIFE with no
`import`/`export` and no runtime module resolution (jellyfin-web's injection context does not
support ES modules at this stage) - esbuild's job is exactly to erase the module boundary at build
time while the source keeps it at edit time.

The injector is unaffected in shape: `/usr/lib/jellyfin-plus/jellyfin-plus.js` is still
canonical on the server, copied from the one file the build script produces, and it still copies it
into the web root and bumps a cache-buster. **What changed**: the cache-buster is no longer a
hand-maintained integer (see below), and `web/jellyfin-plus.js` is no longer a file to keep "in sync"
by committing it - it does not exist until built. `scripts/proxmox-build.sh` and the manual steps in
`INSTALL.md` both build it fresh (`npm install` in `web/`, then `scripts/build-web-panel.sh`) before
publishing it, every time. **Editing the web copy directly gets silently reverted while the buster
still advances**, so browsers cache the old script under a new URL - build from `web/src/`, never
hand-patch the output.

**Never reach for a global that "should" exist.** `window.playbackManager` does not exist in
jellyfin-web 12.1; the only file in the whole web tree naming it was this script. Live apply silently
never ran, and the panel never closed on playback stop, for an entire session before anyone noticed.
Find things **by shape** - an export carrying the methods you need - inside the modules the script
already wraps. Shapes survive minification and module renumbering; names and ids do not.

The webpack chunk global here is the bare **`webpackChunk`**, not `webpackChunkjellyfin_web`.

## The failure mode this project keeps hitting

**Something renders, is stored, and is never sent.** It has happened twice:

- `addParams` wrote eight axes and not `neural`. Every neural level picked did nothing, silently, for
  two sessions.
- `window.playbackManager` was undefined, so every selection stayed in the browser. The server then
  fell back to its dashboard default and reported honestly on *that* - which read as three unrelated
  bugs and was one.

So when something "does not work", **prove the whole chain before theorising**:

```
panel selection -> localStorage -> addParams writes the param -> param in TranscodingUrl
  -> server Option() reads it -> the BUILT FFMPEG COMMAND changes -> session record reports it
```

`journalctl -u jellyfin | grep libplacebo` shows the built command. That is the whole audit; it needs
no harness. Check the reverse too - an axis at off must **not** appear in the command.

## Reporting back

State plainly what was verified versus assumed. "Deployed and restarted cleanly" is not "a served
segment came back at 1920x1080". If a verification could not be run, say so rather than implying
coverage. Several bugs here were found only because someone re-checked a claim already reported as
working.

**Prefer shipping to proving.** The user has repeatedly cut benchmarking in favour of working
features, and has been right to: an unverified feature that ships beats a verified harness that does
not. Correctness checks still earn their place - they are what tells you the feature works at all.

If a user's objection contradicts a measurement, take it seriously and design a test that could prove
them right. The Anime4K-versus-FSRCNNX question settled that way: the original benchmark measured
only at the shader's native ratio, and the user's instinct about their own content was correct.

## Known open wart

`effective()` returns a hard-coded `sr: LADDER_SR` (`fsrcnnx`) for every ladder stage, and the panel
re-seeds preferences from it on each render. So while the Quality slider owns the session, the Detail
control is forced back to fsrcnnx, and another SR level only sticks by flipping the stage to Custom.
Deliberate while the ladder *is* an FSRCNNX ladder; worth revisiting now that ratio-agnostic levels
exist.

## Deploying, and the one step that is easy to forget

`scripts/proxmox-build.sh` does the whole thing on the server: fetch, build both assemblies,
optionally rebuild ffmpeg with `--with-ffmpeg`, stage, end in-flight transcodes, restart, publish the
client. It refuses to deploy an ffmpeg missing any of the five filters and restores the previous one.

**The cache-buster in `scripts/jellyfin-plus-webinject` is no longer a hand-bumped integer**
(as of the `real-es-modules` pass, 2026-09-24). It used to be `VERSION=N`, manually incremented,
wrong in both directions when forgotten: a stale buster served every browser the OLD script from
cache under the same URL, so a day of client work landed on nobody while the server reported the
new behaviour; a bumped buster over an unchanged web copy was the failure the injector's own
comments already warned about. The script now computes `VERSION` itself, at install time, as the
first 10 hex characters of `sha256sum` over the exact `$SRC` file (`/usr/lib/jellyfin-plus/
jellyfin-plus.js`) it is about to install - so the buster cannot drift from the content being served:
an unchanged rebuild reuses the same hash and URL, and any real content change gets a new one, with
no line to remember to edit either way. Nothing else about the injector's calling convention
changed - it still takes no arguments and still runs unmodified from the apt hook in
`/etc/apt/apt.conf.d/99-jellyfin-plus`. (The plugin was renamed from GPU Upscale to Jellyfin Plus; the
injector also removes any leftover `gpu-upscale.js` script tag so the old and new bundles never load
together, and `web/src/lib/storage-migrate.js` carries the old `gpuUpscale*` localStorage keys over.)

The C# half and the config page need a rebuild and a restart to take effect. The client script does
not: publish it and bump the buster.

**`proxmox-build.sh` builds from GitHub, so it only deploys pushed commits.** To deploy unpushed work
(e.g. to prove it on the box before pushing), build on the Mac against a copy of the server's DLLs
and stage by hand:

```bash
# once per session: the server's assemblies, for building
ssh -p 2298 root@192.168.1.2 "pct exec 114 -- bash -c 'cd /usr/lib/jellyfin/bin && tar -cf - *.dll'" | tar -C <scratch>/jfbin -xf -
dotnet publish src         -c Release -p:JellyfinBin=<scratch>/jfbin -o out
dotnet publish src/patcher -c Release -p:JellyfinBin=<scratch>/jfbin -o out-patcher
scripts/build-web-panel.sh
# on CT114: wait for no transcodes, then
#   /usr/lib/jellyfin-plus/staged/ <- Jellyfin.Plugin.Plus.dll, .deps.json, .Patcher.dll, 0Harmony.dll
#   /usr/local/sbin/jellyfin-plus-activate        (backup to previous/, swap, restart; --rollback)
#   install jellyfin-plus.js into /usr/lib/jellyfin-plus/ and run /usr/local/sbin/jellyfin-plus-webinject
```

Transfer with `scp` to the Proxmox host, then `pct push 114`. Check the startup log for the
`optional:` line (every optional patch listed) and `Loaded plugin: Jellyfin Plus`.

## Working with parallel agents

Most of the QoL work was built by parallel Sonnet agents, each in its own git worktree, then merged
and deployed once by the main thread. What made that work:

- **A shared brief in a file** (scratchpad), naming the wire contract, the environment (jfbin, Jellyfin
  12.3 source checkouts with the v12.1..v12.3 tags for diffing, the real-DB copy), build/test commands and hard rules (no deploy, no SSH,
  commit identity, no library content).
- **Disjoint file ownership.** Shared files - `web/src/bootstrap.js`, `src/patcher/Transcoding/UpscalePatches.cs`
  (`ApplyOptional`), `context-map.md`, `ENHANCEMENTS.md` - take minimal additive edits only; the main
  thread resolves the trivial merge conflicts.
- **Agents never deploy.** The main thread merges, builds, deploys once, and verifies live.
- Agents commit with `GIT_AUTHOR_*`/`GIT_COMMITTER_*` env vars (sanchitd5@live.com); the
  `git -c user.email=...` form is refused by a hook in their sandbox.
- Remove merged worktrees and branches promptly - an unmerged branch is history you may later need to
  scrub (see AGENTS.md invariant 18).

## Environment quirks (this Mac / this harness)

- **The session scratchpad is wiped when the session restarts.** Anything that must survive (the
  real-DB copy, harnesses you will reuse) belongs outside it, e.g. `~/.local/share/jellyfin-plus-*`.
  `jfbin` and the Jellyfin source checkouts are cheap to recreate.
- `ctx_*` tools refuse paths outside the repo root: use native Read/Grep for the scratchpad and the
  Jellyfin source checkouts.
- Inline interpreter code (`python3 -c`, heredoc to `python3`) is blocked: write a script file, then
  run it. On CT114, push scripts with `pct push` rather than quoting them through two shells.
- macOS has no `timeout`. And `pgrep -f <name>` inside `bash -c "..."` matches its own command line -
  check a process another way.

## Two bugs that only surfaced by using it

Both passed every static check and neither was findable from the code alone. When a change touches
the panel, open it during playback before calling it done.

- The panel sits over the player, which binds the wheel to volume, so scrolling the enhancement list
  changed the sound until the panel stopped the event.
- Live apply re-negotiates the stream, and a direct-playing session has nothing to re-negotiate, so
  picking an enhancement did nothing until it timed out. It now re-plays the item at its position,
  which is what backing out and reopening was doing by hand.
